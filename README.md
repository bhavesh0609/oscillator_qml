# Hybrid Modeling of Dynamical Systems using Quantum and Classical ML

This project models the dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator using a hybrid machine learning pipeline that integrates classical regressors with a quantum variational algorithm.

## Overview

The system forecasts displacement over time using:

- **Classical Models**: Random Forest, SVR, MLP  
- **Quantum Model**: Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR) using Qiskit

Quantum computing is applied through a parameterized quantum circuit trained using classical optimization, demonstrating the potential of hybrid models for dynamic physical systems.
